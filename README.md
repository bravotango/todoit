## User Story

```md
AS A person with lots to do

I WANT to be able to view and manage my todo list
SO THAT I can get more done
```

## Satisfied Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a react application that accepts user input

WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with predefined todos

WHEN I add text to the 1 input present on the page and click 'Add'
THEN I am presented with a formatted list displaying all the todo including the newly added todo

WHEN I click on a todo that is not complete
THEN I am presented with the todo crossed out, a green checkmark indicating complete, and the completed count is incremented

WHEN I click on a todo that is complete
THEN I am presented with the todo, a grey checkbox with no checkmark indicating not complete, and the completed count is decremented

WHEN I click 'Edit' next to a todo
THEN I am presented with a formatted input with the value set to the todo.title, a 'Save' button that allows the updated the selected todo

WHEN I click 'Delete' next to a todo
THEN I am presented with a updated list of todos with the deleted todo removed.
```
